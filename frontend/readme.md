# Frontend

This directory contains the frontend code.
You can add a subpage by creating a new folder in the `src/pages` directory and adding its to the vite config in `vite.config.ts`.

## Dev

To update the API client from the backend, run `update-api-client.sh`! This is necessary when you make changes to the backend.
